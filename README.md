# STEAM-Game-Design

Experimental analyses to add rigor to the prototyping and play-testing process of game design. Focused on Artful Eye, the Art+Science title in my STEAM game series.

Analyses take in quantitative information about the attributes on each card to allow for probability analyses in R.
